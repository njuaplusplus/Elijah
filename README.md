# Official Code for Elijah (AAAI 2024 and NeurIPS 2023 Workshop BUGS)

This is the PyTorch implementation for the AAAI 2024 paper "Elijah: Eliminating Backdoors Injected in Diffusion Models via Distribution Shift". This work also appears in the NeurIPS 2023 Workshop BUGS.

Currently, we only added code for baddiffusion in this repo. We will update the code for villandiffusion and trojdiff later.
